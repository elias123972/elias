        Fingerprint identification is one of the most well-known and publicized biometrics. Because of their uniqueness 
        and consistency over time, fingerprints have been used for identification for over a century, more recently 
        becoming automated (i.e. a biometric) due to advancements in computing capabilities. Fingerprint identification 
        is popular because of the inherent ease in acquisition, the numerous sources (10 fingers) available for collection,
         and their established use and collections by law enforcement and immigration.
        The practice of using fingerprints as a method of identifying individuals has been in use since the 
        late nineteenth century when Sir Francis Galton defined some of the points or characteristics from which 
        fingerprints can be identified. These “Galton Points” are the foundation for the science of fingerprint
         identification, which has expanded and transitioned over the past century. Fingerprint identification 
         began its transition to automation in the late 1960s along with the emergence of computing technologies.
          With the advent of computers, a subset of the Galton Points, referred to as minutiae, has been utilized 
          to develop automated fingerprint technology.
        A fingerprint usually appears as a series of dark lines that represent the high, peaking portion of the 
        friction ridge skin, while the valley between these ridges appears as white space and are the low, shallow 
        portion of the friction ridge skin. Fingerprint identification is based primarily on the minutiae, or the 
        location and direction of the ridge endings and bifurcations (splits) along a ridge path.
        A variety of sensor types — optical, capacitive, ultrasound, and thermal — are used for collecting the digital 
        image of a fingerprint surface. Optical sensors take an image of the fingerprint, and are the most common sensor today.
        The two main categories of fingerprint matching techniques are minutiae-based matching and pattern matching. 
        Pattern matching simply compares two images to see how similar they are. Pattern matching is usually used in
         fingerprint systems to detect duplicates. The most widely used recognition technique, minutiae-based matching,
          relies on the minutiae points, specifically the location and direction of each point.
