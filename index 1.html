      Ethnic Federalism in Ethiopia
      The federal system of governance was established along ethno-linguistic lines by the transitional  government of 
      ethiopia after the defeat of the Derg regime in 1991. Tetransitional charter of the transitional government 
      rognized Eritrea’s secession and the rights of nations and nationalities to self-administration up to and inuding 
      succession. The 1994 contitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) 
      considers ethnic contradiction as the primary problem in the country’s politics and reaffirms ethnic federalism with the 
      rig to self admin stration for all regional states including the right to secession (Adege Ethiopian People’s 
      Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) constitution establishes a federal state structe composed of two distinct 
      entities, the federal state and the regional entities.
       According to the 199  constition, both the federal and regional states establish their own institut onal organs,
        legislative, executive 
      and judicial bodies and exercise autonomous power within their sphere of influence. It recognizes nine regional 
      states antwo city administrations. These include Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Beishangu-Gumuz, 
      Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, Gambela and Harari, and Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa city administratns.
       Regional states are divided hierarchically into zones, woredas, special-woredas and kebeles. 
      The 1994 constitution states that the federal and regional governments are required to respect the power of one
       another (Art.0(8)). However, the interference of the federal government on the regional states, and the 
      interference of state organs especially the executive in other organs at both regional and federal state level 
      aretacitly establied in the federal constitution and observed in the practical implementation of the ruling 
      government. 
      The 1994 EPRDF constitution as stated in article 39 (2) recognizes the cultural rights of all ethnic groups 
      “…the right to speak, torite and to develop its own language; to express, to develop and to promote its culture; and to 
      preserve its history”. Regional entities have given an exclusive power to determine their own working language (Tewfik, 2010). Manyc 
      groups become visible and eager to promote their own unique identity either for recoveringheir values or
       for political and economic advantage. In principle, in its Article 39(3), the EPRDF constitution alsallows the 
       right to self-administration and equitable representation at both  he regional and federal levels of government.
        In contrast to the previous regimes, significant improvement has been shown in power devolution from the central
         government to the regional states.
