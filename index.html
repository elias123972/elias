        My name is elias yizingaw I am nineteen years old ,I were live in chagne with my parents ,brother
         ,and grand parents ,but now I live in adiss EiABE ledeta campus with two other dorem mates.life in 
         campus is very different and challenging from before, there are many people in here in different culture
          ,religion ,attitude and behavior I think that is the most challenging part to create harmony relationship
           with this people and live together . I have many good friends in side and out side of campuses and they
            show me good thingâ€™s that help me in my future life ,I am so happy to be here.
        I participate in all extra ccurricular activeties and sport events of my school and try my best to do well.
        My favorite subject is biology, when I study/learn biology many Questions rise on my head and I ask my self
         about nature , humanity and I amazements by life and creatures .
        My hobbies are singing and watching football games, I am the fun of Manchester untid clubs and from players 
        C.Rolando ,I watches every game of united and I think it is creates challenge in my time management to study and also
         I love to sing and one day I will be bast singer.
